# Introduction #
It can often times be useful to get data and put it into a dataframe for further analysis. Here, we practice generating some basic data and then converting that output into a dataframe. To generate the data, we'll be parsing a fasta file via the `Bio` package and then doing the data wrangling and analysis with the `numpy` and `pandas` packages. Make sure these three packages are already been installed. 

The goal here will be to get some basic stats of a fasta file. We will first use an example fasta file and get info on the length of each sequence and then counts of each base.
